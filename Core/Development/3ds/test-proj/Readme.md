note: I had to downgrade citru-rs to version:
`6d6f9c0c18b3ad5d46474939f5ea58950a014f34`
to make it happy with rustc version 1.71.

d-rs has a fix for newer rust versions, so I'll need to update that in order to use later rustc versions.

Also, I don't have a 3Ds to test on, so I can't really do much here.
